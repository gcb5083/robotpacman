This repo is for the Penn State robotics team competing in the annual robot PacMan competition hosted by HURC (Harvard Undergraduate Robotics Club). Contained in this repo is a rudimentary simulation environment to check the validity and efficiency of algorithms, along with swappable algorithms contained in a standalone folder. CAD files for the robot and a list of hardware will be included later.
